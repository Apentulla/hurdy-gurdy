<font size="3">A homeless page is a young courtier who has nowhere to live. I used to be one. Except that I wasn't a courtier... 

<p>
I was born on another planet. The main country on that planet was called the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics and led the workers of the world - united, no less -
to the paradise of communism. My neck of the woods on that planet was 
called People's Republic of Poland. It was a dreary planet. 
Look <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/power-of-taste">here</a> 
for one powerful description - by Zbigniew Herbert - of how dreary it was. <br>
</p>
<p>
But there were universities - relics of better times. I went to one of them: the  
<a href="http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en">Jagiellonian University</a> in Krakow.<font size="3"> I graduated 
from the Jagiellonian, worked at the Department of Logic there (a good part of my heart still is in the seminar room 
where equivalences were proved "towards the stove" and "towards the window"), got my PhD. 
Meanwhile, on 4 June 1989 a little miracle happened: semi-free elections were 
held in Poland (exactly on the day of Tiananmen massacre: <b>about a year before the Berlin wall fell</b>). 
Afterwards, my planet began drifting towards your planet.</p>
<p>
In 1998 I moved to <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/index-e.html">Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a>,
where I worked for 5 years. In 2003, I moved to Australia, first to ANU
in Canberra, then - after a stint in Italy and Portugal - to Melbourne. I maintain a strong connection with the 
<a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/">ALOPHIS</a> group from the University of Cagliari.  
<br>

Two words that describe what I do: logic and algebra. <br>

Three words that describe what I like: mountains, music and literature. Not necessarily in that order.<br>

Three acronyms that describe what I teach: MAT4MT, MAT3DSA, MAT2ALC. 
If you do not know what they mean, you are like myself. Acronyms should be banned!<br>

This is the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/model-theory">model-theory</a> course link. 
It may not work now because google sites decided to make it easier to edit web pages, which messed up my simplistic html.<br>

Here I may put slides of some of my talks (or, I may not)<br>

Here is my <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomasz_Kowalski3">Research Gate page</a>. 
And here is the page at <a href="http://latrobe.academia.edu/TomaszKowalski">Academia.edu</a>. <br>

I am not a statistician, but could not help putting in 
a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/a-word-on-statistics">a word on statistics</a> 
by Wislawa Szymborska.<br>
<p>
One more Polish connection - the last one, I promise. Some time ago I came across two books (in Polish), which
seriously made the the following claim <i>it would have been better if 
just before the outbreak of World War II Poland took a strategic move 
very different from what happened in real history.</i> I was not amused.
What I did not like was the assumption that making a different 
strategic move was not only possible, but indeed rational in the 
circumstances. Well, let's see... moves in strategic games call for a 
game-theoretic analysis, so 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/strategic-games-on-xemya">here is one</a> 
dressed in a sci-fi costume to avoid offending sensibilities.<br>
